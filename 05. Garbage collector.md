### Garbage Collector  

Garbage Collector (GC) is a memory management feature in programming languages like Java and Go. Its main job is to automatically free up memory by removing objects that are no longer needed. This helps prevent memory leaks and improves application performance.  

#### **How It Works**  
1. **Allocating Memory** – When an object is created, memory is allocated in the heap.  
2. **Tracking Objects** – The program keeps track of objects that are in use (reachable) and those that are not (unreachable).  
3. **Collecting Garbage** – The GC removes objects that are no longer referenced by the program.  

#### **Garbage Collection Strategies**  
- **Mark and Sweep** – The GC first marks all reachable objects, then removes unmarked ones.  
- **Stop-the-World** – The program is paused while GC runs, which may cause performance issues.  
- **Generational GC** – Divides objects into young and old generations, optimizing collection for short-lived objects.  
- **Reference Counting** – Tracks how many references an object has; when it reaches zero, the object is deleted.  

#### **Advantages**  
- Prevents memory leaks.  
- Automates memory management, reducing developer effort.  
- Helps optimize memory usage.  

#### **Disadvantages**  
- Can cause performance overhead.  
- Unpredictable pauses (especially in stop-the-world collections).  
- Not always suitable for real-time systems.  

In languages like Go, the GC is optimized for low latency, while Java uses different GC algorithms (like G1 and ZGC) to balance performance. Understanding how GC works helps developers write more efficient code and avoid memory-related issues.
