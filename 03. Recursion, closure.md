### Recursion and Closure  

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is commonly used when a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type. A recursive function needs a **base case** to stop recursion; otherwise, it will run indefinitely.  

Example: A classic example of recursion is the **factorial** function:  

```go
func factorial(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * factorial(n-1)
}
```
Recursion is useful for tasks like tree traversal, searching, and sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort). However, it can lead to **stack overflow** if the recursion depth is too deep, so it's important to consider iterative solutions in such cases.

**Closure** is a function that captures and remembers variables from its surrounding scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are useful for maintaining state in functions.  

Example:  

```go
func counter() func() int {
    count := 0
    return func() int {
        count++
        return count
    }
}

c := counter()
fmt.Println(c()) // 1
fmt.Println(c()) // 2
```

Here, the anonymous function inside `counter()` "remembers" the `count` variable, even after `counter()` has returned.  

Closures are often used for **callback functions, state management, and function factories**. They allow for more flexible and reusable code.

Both recursion and closures are powerful techniques in programming. Recursion helps break down problems, while closures help maintain state and encapsulate behavior.
