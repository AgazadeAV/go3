### **Package embed in Go**  

The `embed` package in Go allows embedding files and directories into the final binary at compile time. This is useful when you need to include static files like configuration files, HTML templates, or images without requiring external dependencies after compilation.  

#### **Key Features**  
1. **Embedding Files** – You can embed a single file using `//go:embed` followed by a variable of type `string` or `[]byte`.  
2. **Embedding Multiple Files** – You can embed multiple files using a `fs.FS` variable, which allows accessing embedded files like a file system.  
3. **No External Dependencies** – Everything is packed into the binary, making deployment easier.  
4. **Compile-Time Embedding** – The files are included during compilation, so they don’t change at runtime.  

#### **Example Usage**  
```go
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"fmt"
)

//go:embed config.yaml
var configFile string

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Config file content:", configFile)
}
```
This embeds the `config.yaml` file into the binary and prints its content.  

Another example with multiple files:  
```go
//go:embed static/*
var staticFiles embed.FS
```
This allows accessing all files inside the `static` directory.  

#### **Limitations**  
- Works only with Go 1.16 and later.  
- Embedded files must be known at compile time (no dynamic embedding).  
- Can’t modify embedded files at runtime.  

In summary, `embed` is a powerful feature for including static assets directly in a Go binary, simplifying deployment and reducing external dependencies.
