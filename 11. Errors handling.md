**Error Handling**  

Error handling is an important part of programming because it helps make applications more reliable and user-friendly. Errors can happen for different reasons, such as invalid user input, network failures, or system limitations.  

### **Types of Errors**  
1. **Syntax Errors** – These happen when the code has mistakes in its structure, like missing a semicolon or using the wrong keyword. They are detected at compile time.  
2. **Runtime Errors** – These occur while the program is running, such as dividing by zero or trying to access a null pointer.  
3. **Logical Errors** – These happen when the program runs but gives the wrong output due to a mistake in the logic. These are the hardest to find.  

### **Error Handling Approaches**  
1. **Return Codes** – Some functions return special values to indicate an error, but this method requires extra checks in the code.  
2. **Exception Handling** – Many languages like Java and Go use exceptions to handle errors more efficiently. In Java, we use `try-catch` blocks to catch exceptions and handle them properly.  
3. **Panic and Recovery** – Some languages like Go use `panic()` for critical errors and `recover()` to regain control.  
4. **Logging and Debugging** – Writing errors to logs helps developers understand and fix issues later.  

### **Best Practices**  
- Always handle expected errors gracefully instead of letting the program crash.  
- Use meaningful error messages to help users and developers understand what went wrong.  
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.  
- Don't ignore exceptions; handle them properly to avoid hidden issues.  

Good error handling improves software quality and makes applications more stable and user-friendly.
