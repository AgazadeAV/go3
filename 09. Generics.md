Generics in Go allow us to write flexible and reusable code by defining functions and data structures that can work with different types. Before Go 1.18, we had to use interfaces and type assertions to achieve similar functionality, but generics provide a more efficient and type-safe way to do this.

### Key Points:
1. **Type Parameters** – Generics introduce type parameters, which let us write functions and structures that work with any type. We define them using square brackets, e.g., `func Print[T any](value T) { fmt.Println(value) }`.

2. **Constraints** – We can restrict type parameters to specific types using constraints. The `any` constraint allows any type, but we can also use interfaces to limit accepted types.

3. **Generic Data Structures** – With generics, we can create data structures like a generic `Stack[T]` or `List[T]`, making them more reusable.

4. **Type Inference** – In many cases, Go can infer the type parameter, so we don’t need to explicitly specify it when calling generic functions.

5. **Performance Considerations** – Generics improve code reusability, but they may slightly increase compilation time. However, Go optimizes generic code well, keeping runtime performance close to non-generic code.

Generics make Go more powerful while keeping its simplicity. They are useful when we need to write functions or data structures that work with different types but still want to maintain type safety.
