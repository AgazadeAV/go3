Reflection in programming is a mechanism that allows a program to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. In Go, the `reflect` package provides tools for working with types and values dynamically.

### Key Points:
1. **Inspecting Types and Values**  
   The `reflect` package allows us to get information about types and values at runtime using `reflect.TypeOf()` and `reflect.ValueOf()`. This is useful when working with interfaces or unknown data types.

2. **Modifying Values**  
   Reflection enables us to modify variables dynamically. However, to change a value, we need to use `reflect.Value.Elem()` and ensure it is addressable.

3. **Working with Structs and Fields**  
   We can inspect struct fields and tags using `reflect.Type.Field()`, which is useful for libraries like JSON serialization or database mappers.

4. **Calling Methods Dynamically**  
   Reflection allows calling methods on objects dynamically using `reflect.Value.Method()`, which is useful when building frameworks or handling plugins.

5. **Performance Considerations**  
   Reflection is powerful but can slow down execution and make code harder to understand. It should be used only when necessary.

### Common Use Cases:
- **JSON serialization and deserialization**  
- **ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers)**  
- **Dependency injection frameworks**  
- **Building flexible APIs**  

Even though reflection is useful, Go encourages using it only when there are no better alternatives.
