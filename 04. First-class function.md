**First-Class Functions**  

In programming, a **first-class function** is a function that is treated like any other variable. This means that a function can be:  

- **Assigned to a variable** – We can store a function in a variable and use it later.  
- **Passed as an argument** – A function can be passed as a parameter to another function.  
- **Returned from another function** – A function can return another function as its result.  

This concept is important because it allows **higher-order functions**, which take functions as arguments or return them. It is a key feature in functional programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Go.  

For example, in Go, functions can be assigned to variables and passed around:  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    var operation func(int, int) int
    operation = add
    fmt.Println(operation(3, 4)) // Output: 7
}
```  

First-class functions help in creating flexible, reusable, and modular code by enabling patterns like **callbacks**, **closures**, and **function composition**.
