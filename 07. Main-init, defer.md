### **Main, init, and defer in Go**  

In Go, the `main`, `init`, and `defer` functions play important roles in program execution.  

#### **main() Function**  
- The `main` function is the entry point of a Go program.  
- It must be in the `main` package and doesn't take arguments or return values.  
- The program starts executing from `main()`, and when it finishes, the program exits.  
- Example:  
  ```go
  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
  }
  ```

#### **init() Function**  
- The `init` function is used to initialize variables or perform setup before `main()` runs.  
- It is executed automatically before `main()` and does not take parameters or return anything.  
- Each package can have multiple `init` functions (even in different files), and they execute in the order they appear.  
- Example:  
  ```go
  package main

  import "fmt"

  func init() {
      fmt.Println("Initializing...")
  }

  func main() {
      fmt.Println("Running main function")
  }
  ```
  **Output:**  
  ```
  Initializing...
  Running main function
  ```

#### **defer Statement**  
- `defer` postpones the execution of a function until the surrounding function (like `main`) finishes.  
- It is often used for resource cleanup (closing files, releasing locks, etc.).  
- Deferred calls are executed in **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** order.  
- Example:  
  ```go
  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main() {
      defer fmt.Println("First deferred")
      defer fmt.Println("Second deferred")
      fmt.Println("Main function running")
  }
  ```
  **Output:**  
  ```
  Main function running
  Second deferred
  First deferred
  ```

### **Conclusion**  
- `main()` is the starting point of the program.  
- `init()` runs automatically before `main()` and is used for setup.  
- `defer` is useful for delaying execution until a function exits, helping with cleanup.
